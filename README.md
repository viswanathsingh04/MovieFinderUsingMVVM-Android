**Movie Finder** is a sample android application 📱to search movies 🍿using OMDb API which is built to demonstrate use of *Modern Android development* tools. It has been built using kotlin with clean architecture principles and MVVM pattern as well as Architecture Components. Dedicated to all Android Developers with ❤️. 


## About
The app in itself is a simple movie searching app. Clicking the movie list item it shows the detail of the movie. While this is not an extremely complex app, it isn't a silly Hello World one either, so the hope is that it'll cover regular use cases for a basic application.


## Sailent Features:
- Search the movies.
- View the list of movies based on the search result.
- View the released date, genre, IMDB rating and short plot.
